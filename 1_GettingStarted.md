### WHAT ?
Spring Boot is an open source Java-based framework used to create a micro Service.  
It is developed by Pivotal Team and is used to build stand-alone and production ready spring applications.  

Spring Boot provides a good platform for Java developers to develop a stand-alone and production-grade spring application that you can just run. You can get started with minimum configurations without the need for an entire Spring configuration setup.

## What is Micro Service ?
Micro Service is an architecture that allows the developers to develop and deploy services independently.  
Each service running has its own process and this achieves the lightweight model to support business applications.

Microservices are an architectural approach where a single application is composed of many small, loosely coupled, and independently deployable components or services.  

Microservices are autonomous: Each microservice can be developed, deployed, and operated independently without affecting other services.

In a monolithic architecture, all processes run as a single service, tightly coupled. Microservices break down an application into independent components, each running as a separate service.
